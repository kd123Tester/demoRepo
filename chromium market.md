<h2 data-start="276" data-end="303">Chromium Market Overview</h2>
<p data-start="305" data-end="769">The global chromium market has been growing steadily, driven by rising stainless steel demand, industrialization in emerging economies, and increasing applications in sectors like automotive, aerospace, electronics, and construction. According to Straits Research, the market size was <strong data-start="590" data-end="619">USD 23.88 billion in 2024</strong>, and is projected to grow to <strong data-start="649" data-end="678">USD 38.34 billion by 2033</strong> at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of <strong data-start="722" data-end="730">5.4%</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="771" data-end="1097">Chromium is used in many forms: ferrochromium alloys, chromium chemicals (e.g. chromic acid, sodium dichromate), metallic chromium, refractory materials, electroplating, etc. Its key property of corrosion resistance makes it essential in stainless steel and other high-performance alloys.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 data-start="1104" data-end="1122">Regional Trends</h2>
