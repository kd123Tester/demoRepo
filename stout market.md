<h2 data-start="7479" data-end="7499">Market Challenges</h2>
<p data-start="7501" data-end="7560">Despite the promising outlook, there are several obstacles:</p>
<ul data-start="7562" data-end="8959">
<li data-start="7562" data-end="7803">
<p data-start="7564" data-end="7803"><strong data-start="7564" data-end="7605">High Volatility of Raw Material Costs</strong>: Ingredients like barley/malt, hops, cocoa, coffee etc. are subject to agricultural fluctuations, climate change, supply constraints. This affects margins.&nbsp;</p>

<li data-start="7804" data-end="8024">
<p data-start="7806" data-end="8024"><strong data-start="7806" data-end="7839">Regulatory &amp; Taxation Hurdles</strong>: Different countries have strict regulations on alcohol content, labeling, taxes. Some regions restrict imports, ABV, or impose excise duties.&nbsp;</p>

<li data-start="8417" data-end="8665">
<p data-start="8419" data-end="8665"><strong data-start="8419" data-end="8461">Distribution &amp; Infrastructure Barriers</strong>: In developing markets, transportation, cold chain, storage, retail distribution may be less developed. Also in many places on-trade (bars, pubs) were hit during COVID and may not have fully recovered.</p>

<li data-start="8666" data-end="8959">
<p data-start="8668" data-end="8959"><strong data-start="8668" data-end="8712">Sustainability &amp; Environmental Pressures</strong>: Brewing is water- and energy-intensive; increasing expectations (from consumers, regulators, investors) for sustainability, low carbon footprint, responsible sourcing, waste management.
