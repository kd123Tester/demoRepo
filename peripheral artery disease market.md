<h2 data-start="334" data-end="385">Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) Market: Overview</h2>
<p data-start="387" data-end="737">Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a circulatory disorder where blockages or narrowing (due to atherosclerosis, plaque build-up) in arteries outside the heart and brain&mdash;especially in the legs&mdash;reduce blood flow. Symptoms range from intermittent claudication (leg pain when walking) to critical limb ischemia (severe blockages risking tissue damage).</p>
<p data-start="739" data-end="879">The PAD market involves treatments (devices &amp; drugs), diagnostics, care settings (hospitals, clinics), and global/regional health systems.</p>
