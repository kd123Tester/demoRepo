<h2 data-start="667" data-end="705">India Animal Feed Market&nbsp;</h2>
<p data-start="707" data-end="937">The India animal feed market was valued at <strong data-start="750" data-end="777">USD 1.0 billion in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong data-start="823" data-end="850">USD 2.2 billion by 2033</strong>, registering a <strong data-start="866" data-end="883">CAGR of ~9.0%</strong> over 2024-2033.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-start="939" data-end="1196">This growth is being driven by rising demand for animal protein (meat, eggs, dairy), increasing livestock population, urbanization, rising disposable incomes, changing dietary preferences, and policy/government support.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 data-start="1203" data-end="1221">Regional Trends</h2>
<p data-start="1223" data-end="1345">Understanding how different parts of India contribute and grow in this market is key. Here are the main regional insights:</p>
<ul data-start="1347" data-end="2479">
<li data-start="1347" data-end="1572">
<p data-start="1349" data-end="1572"><strong data-start="1349" data-end="1364">South India</strong> is currently the <strong data-start="1382" data-end="1400">largest market</strong> for animal feed. States like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka are strong in poultry, dairy and feed processing infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1573" data-end="1882">
<p data-start="1575" data-end="1882"><strong data-start="1575" data-end="1589">West India</strong> (Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan) is the <strong data-start="1631" data-end="1657">fastest-growing region</strong>, with increasing investments in feed mills, rising demand for cattle feed linked to dairy, as well as poultry.
