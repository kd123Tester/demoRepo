<p data-start="311" data-end="722">A <em data-start="313" data-end="321">genset</em> (generator set) is a combination of an engine (diesel, gas, propane etc.) and an electric generator, used to provide power in cases when grid supply is unavailable or insufficient. The global genset market has been growing steadily, driven by industrialization, urbanization, rising energy demand, unreliable grids, and needs for backup/prime power in commercial, industrial, and residential sectors.</p>
<p data-start="724" data-end="993">According to StraitsResearch, the global genset market was valued at <strong>USD 24.5 billion</strong><strong data-start="793" data-end="821">&nbsp;in 2024</strong> and is projected to grow to <strong>USD 38.83 billion</strong><strong data-start="850" data-end="879">&nbsp;by 2033</strong>, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about <strong data-start="932" data-end="941">5.25%</strong> over 2025-33.&nbsp;</p>
