<h3 data-start="380" data-end="399">Market Overview</h3>
<p data-start="401" data-end="980">Ammonium acetate (NH₄C₂H₃O₂) is a white crystalline salt formed from ammonia and acetic acid. It is used in a variety of applications: as a buffering agent in pharmaceuticals, as a food additive (for acidity regulation, preservatives), in agriculture (fertilizers, insect attractants), chemical synthesis, lab reagents, etc. The recent years have seen steady growth in demand driven by rising pharmaceutical R&amp;D, growth in processed foods, and agricultural modernization. Depending on source, the market projections differ somewhat but most point to moderate growth in the 2020s.</p>
<p data-start="982" data-end="1234">For example, a report by values the global ammonium acetate market at about <strong data-start="1075" data-end="1103">USD 9.64 billion in 2024</strong>, and forecasts growth to USD 13.48 billion by 2033, with a CAGR of <strong data-start="1171" data-end="1180"> 3.8%</strong> over 2025&ndash;2033.</p>
<p data-start="1236" data-end="1387">Other sources show somewhat higher numbers or steeper growth, depending on assumptions (application mix, region).&nbsp;</p>
