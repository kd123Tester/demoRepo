<li data-start="2693" data-end="3078">
<p data-start="2695" data-end="3078"><strong data-start="2695" data-end="2706">Plastic</strong>: This is the largest segment in terms of share. UV-treated, impact-modified, food-grade polyethylene types are common.&nbsp;<br data-start="2863" data-end="2866" /> Plastic tanks are popular due to low cost, ease of manufacturing, lighter weight, simpler installation, multiple shapes/sizes. Expected CAGR ~3.7% for plastic segment.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li data-start="3082" data-end="3306">
<p data-start="3084" data-end="3306"><strong data-start="3084" data-end="3093">Steel</strong>: Second largest. Steel tanks are durable, often galvanized, used in more heavy-duty settings. Problems include corrosion, weight, cost of transportation and installation.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="3310" data-end="3534">
<p data-start="3312" data-end="3534"><strong data-start="3312" data-end="3326">Fiberglass</strong>: Smaller share currently, but chosen for corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, lighter weight vs steel. Usually for more specialized or demanding installations.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li data-start="3536" data-end="4031">
