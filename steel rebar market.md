<h2 data-start="289" data-end="320">Steel Rebar Market: Overview</h2>
<p data-start="322" data-end="732">Steel reinforcing bars (rebars) are steel rods used as tensioning members in reinforced concrete and masonry structures. They provide tensile strength to concrete, which on its own is weak in tension. The steel rebar market is being driven by infrastructure investment, urbanization, more stringent building codes (especially for seismic durability), and emerging demands for more sustainable steel production.</p>
<p data-start="734" data-end="1211">Recent reports (e.g. StraitsResearch&rsquo;s <em data-start="773" data-end="793">Steel Rebar Market</em> report) put the global steel rebar market size at about <strong data-start="850" data-end="880">USD 241.35 billion in 2024</strong>, with projected growth to USD 337.61 billion by 2033, at a CAGR of 3.8% for 2025-2033. Other sources give slightly different bases and forecasts depending on scope (product types, regions, etc.).&nbsp;</p>
